# Pixelflow !

This is my personal computer vision library, a derived work from ["The Ancient Secrets of Computer Vision"](https://pjreddie.com/courses/computer-vision/) a course given by [Josep Redmon](https://pjreddie.com) at Washington University. 

This library is primarily focused on the implementation of academical papers to extend Josep Redmon work.

To get started, make sure you have `git`, a C compiler, and `make` installed. Then run:

    git clone https://github.com/pedrofrodenas/pixelflow.git
    cd pixelflow
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make
